<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

There are chatting applications on the web, but what makes POWOW special is giving users the ability to do more. POWOW will give users the edge in communication and allow them to discover new peers across the internet. Alternative version built with MERN stack can be found in deprecated folder located [here](https://github.com/adj2424/video-chat-website).

Features in POWOW:

- Server side rendering with hydration.
- Allowing users to privately create their own Rooms via a specific key for chatting and video streaming.
- Join pre-existing rooms with Room ID's.
- Minimal design choice to allow for easy readability.
- API endpoints for data manipulation with MongoDB and Agora.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Replace .env.local.template with .env.local and add the credentials.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
